Radial Mk2 Cockpit v.1.1
last updated 9/30/14

This mod uses ModuleManager (tested with version 2.3.5) to make the Mk2 cockpit radially attachable.



You need a radially attachable Cockpit for your new Cruiser? Want to fly that big orange tank like a plane?

This mod allows radial placement of the Mk2 Inline cockpit on any surface. That includes panels and large tanks.

EVA is not affected and works fine!

No new parts, just a fix of the original Mk2 Cockpit. Nothing else is changed and all your game saves will not be influenced!

This mod makes use of the ModuleManager .dll (tested against version 2.3.5)  by Ialdabaoth and Sarbian for easier use on both Steam and non-Steam KSP installs. Simply drag and drop the GameData folder in this zip file into your KSP install folder.

This mod was made without permission or knowledge of the original maker of the part it modifies (C7). It uses no assets from the original part except the .cfg file, which I will remove if asked to do so.
 
ModuleManager, similarly, is not mine. Many thanks to Ialdabaoth for creating it and Sarbian for subsequently extending and maintaining it.
